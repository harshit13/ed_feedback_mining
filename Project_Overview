General Description of the project:-  We have student's Feedback data which has information about student, student's family and student's background
									  and student's performance data which says about school facilities and student's performance in many subjects.


Data Frames: - 1) Spark
				
					As data is very large around 20 GB, to handle it distributedly, we are using spark framework throughout the project.

			   2) Tensorflow
			   
			   		Here we are using student's Feedback data and their performance data to train our model and predict performances in Subject based on students feed_back data
			   		we have used spark, Tensorflow and code is written in learn_perf.py


Concepts:-     1) Hypothesis Testing
					
					Here for any given goal completion, we have tried to pick top 20 and bottom 20 features which affect the completion of goal most.
					we have used spark and code is written in Hypothesis_Testing.py

			   2) Linearity Sensitive Hashing
