### General Description of the project:-  
We have student's Feedback data which has information about student, student's family and student's background and student's performance data which says about school facilities and student's performance in many subjects.


### Data Frames: - 
1) Spark
As data is very large around 20 GB, to handle it distributedly, we are using spark framework throughout the project.

2) Tensorflow
Here we are using student's Feedback data (X) and their performance data (Y) to train our model and predict performances in Subject based on students feed_back data
We have used spark, Tensorflow (MirroredStrategy - Synchronous All Reduce) and code is written in learn_perf.py ( train_and_eval method)

3) HDFS
Data is always stored on  the hdfs with replication=3. Used for the distributed processing for spark.

### Concepts:-     
1) Hypothesis Testing					
Here for any given goal completion, we have tried to pick top 20 and bottom 20 features which affect the completion of goal most.
we have used spark and code is written in Hypothesis_Testing.py

2) Locality Sensitive Hashing

3) Deep Learning
Here we train we custom designed Feed forward NN architecture using Keras Dense Layers.
Train using distributed tensorflow (MirroredStrategy and MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy).
